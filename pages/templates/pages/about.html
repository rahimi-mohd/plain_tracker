        <h3 class="fw-semibold">💡 Why I built this</h3>
        <p>
          Back when I was interning as a Quality Assurance tester, I jumped
          between a bunch of small projects. The biggest headache? 
          <strong>bug tracking</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Fancy trackers had a paywall (and way too many features no one touched),
          while some teams just hacked together a Google Sheet (which worked…
          kinda, but had zero communication tools like comments).  
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I thought: why not make something <em>simple, clean, and actually fun</em> to use?  
          That’s how <strong>Plain Tracker</strong> was born — not to replace the giants, but to
          give people a <u>straight-to-the-point alternative</u>.

        <h3 class="fw-semibold">👥 Who it’s for</h3>
        <p>
          Anyone! From solo users keeping track of daily stuff, to small or
          medium teams that don’t want to wrestle with enterprise software.  
          It’s <em>not just for developers</em> — if you need to track progress, ideas,
          or even your plant-watering schedule 🌱, Plain Tracker’s got your back.

        <h3 class="fw-semibold">⚙️ How to use it</h3>
        <p>
          Right now, you can play with it here on the site — but heads up:
          trackers are public for now (private mode coming soon 👀).  
        </p>

          If you’re a DIY kind of person, you can also 
          <a href="https://github.com/rahimi-mohd/plain_tracker" target="_blank">
          grab the source code from GitHub</a>, and run it locally or host it anywhere you like.
